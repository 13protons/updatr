# updatr

The goal of this project is to create a small and simple update server for your software project to check in and receive updates from.

## Big ideas

Specifying peer dependencies and having plugins to check for each of those dependencies can keep the core nice and light while making `updatr` extendable in the future.

> Note that `updatr` is in an 'alpha' or 'pre-release' state (i.e., it doesn't work yet :)
